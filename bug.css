The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if you try to use `calc()` with units inconsistently, or if there are syntax errors in the calculation expression. For example, forgetting a space between operators or operands can lead to unexpected results.  Another uncommon issue arises from nesting `calc()` expressions improperly, which can confuse the browser's parsing.  Finally, using unsupported units within `calc()` can also cause problems.
